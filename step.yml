        Using a Gradle Wrapper (gradlew) is required, as the wrapper is what makes sure
        that the right Gradle version is installed and used for the build.

        __You can find more information about the Gradle Wrapper (gradlew),
        and about how you can generate one (if you would not have one already)__
        in the official guide at: [https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html).
